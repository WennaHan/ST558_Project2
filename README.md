# ST558_Project2

## Brief description of the app and its purpose.
For this project I’m going to let you choose your own API to query (other than a COVID related API - I
don’t want you to use an API with data related to COVID - I’ve graded too many of those in my time).
A list of free APIs is given here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis (but feel free to use another
source if you find one)
Many of these don’t require a key. If you are worried about sharing a key on github, use one of the key less
ones. For what we are doing it shouldn’t matter (as long as you don’t sign up for a pay API).
You are going to build your own functions for querying the API (not use a package that does it for you).
Please check the required components for the summarizations below before choosing your
API and endpoints to return. You must be returning at least some data that will work for the required
summarizations. (You do not need to create functionality to contact all parts of the API!)

## A list of packages needed to run the app.


## A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to running your app).



## The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
